//8.	Identify and correct the error(s) in each of the following:
/* 

a)	if (age >= 65);
cout << "Age is greater than or equal to 65" << endl; else
cout << "Age is less than 65 << endl";
ANS:
	After the r if condition there should not be a semicolon (;) used.


b)	if ( age >= 65 )
cout << "Age is greater than or equal to 65" << endl; else;
cout << "Age is less than 65 << endl"; 
ANS:
	After else semicolon (;) is not used. 


c)	if (age >= 65)
cout << "Age is greater than or equal to 65" << endl; cout<< "Time to retire";
else;
cout << "Age is less than 65 << endl"; 
ANS:
	After else semicolon (;) is not used.


d)	int x = 1, total; while (x <= 10) { total += x;
++x;
} 
ANS:
	No such error but the variable "total" Should be initialized with Zero.


e)	While (x <= 100) total += x;
++x; 
ANS:
	There are two errors:
		i: The correction of the name of the keyword while from "While" to "while".
		ii: Enclosing the second and third statements within curly braces.


f)	while (y > 0) { cout << y << endl;
++y;
} 
ANS:
	Error in the while statement. Because the given statement is an infinite loop because y will keep increasing
